<h1 id="welcome-to-geonex">Welcome to GeoNEX</h1>
<p>A collection of documentation for GeoNEX users.</p>
<p>This GeoNEX project aims to address key challenges of data-driven geostationary satellite research, including but are not limited to, access to sufficient computing resources, massive data transfer, standardized analysis workflows and reproducibility to communicate analyses so that they can be reused and extended. </p>
<p><em>Before you get started, you might want to check out</em> <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tOD7abmvFd7bYaLMkiPnmYsRvU7VTu9qaGQul6sbh3k/edit?usp=sharing"><em>our project slides</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>This documentation includes both guidelines, examples and source code docs.</p>
<p>The documentation is accessible at <a href="https://geonex.readthedocs.io">https://geonex.readthedocs.io</a></p>
<h2 id="geonex-architecture">GeoNEX Architecture</h2>
<p>A simplified system architecture diagram is shown below. </p>
<p>Geostationary Satellite Images (GOES16/17, Himawari) are hosted on Cloud-based storage (AWS S3 buckets); specific algorithms were registered on Knowledge Hub and hosted on various docker registery services. The batch system includes two sub-parts: AWS Real-time Runner and HPC batcher, which manage computation distribution among a pool of Compute Servers, and launch algorithms container when rules were met. Outputs buckets, GeoNEX database and restful APIs were deployed on top of them to support another two web application: Dashboard and Notebook. The former application is a console to help users to access resources and tasks of GeoNEX, while the latter is a R &amp; D environment for fast-prototype, exploration and education purposes.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="/Users/jxiong1/Desktop/GHI/geonex-doc/docs/assets/SQjI7uLt9hwsgXLunhK680jIV7ZdQS4a5jvMGwHoM4HjYi_EvIhRxYUn1LF0Pznt7UwF3aXNR8I1IxWvPtyfV25eHrbbgR8B6dpwdgAeB__Li4rmrA1fHkkKdvXcMnFs5ju0kt0C.png" /></p>
<p>Users can access and analyze data from the public catalog using GeoNEX containers as  as well as their own analysis once dockerized. Also users can leverage their work to powerful features provided by GEONEX, including real-time analytics, standard preprocessing, cloud detection, visualization, etc.</p>

<h2 id="geonex-glossary">GeoNEX Glossary</h2>
<p>NOTICE<strong>: About the word “IMAGE" and “Container”: Note that we avoid the use of the word </strong>IMAGE<strong> as it is way too vague and it is heavily overloaded, and also easily confused with the </strong>Remote-Sensed Data Products<strong> from satellite or </strong>Imagery-based Map.** In GeoNEX, we use the word "image" to denote very different types of data and data products. We want to evangelize a new way to talk about algorithms/softwares/services running on GeoNEX.</p>
<p>For terms/items from Amazon/AWS not mentioned in this glossary, please refer to the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/glos-chap.html">AWS Glossary</a>.</p>
