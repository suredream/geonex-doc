Get Started How to register docker image? The docker image could come from one public docker hub, where user can directly download it without any permissions. User have to put image\u2019s source, description, user name, email, and user\u2019s organization when registering your image. Once you register the image, the image can be found in NEX Repositories like below: For each image, user can execute \u201cRun\u201d action. If the image has not been downloaded in current running instances, INSTANCE label will show as \u201cnull\u201d. User can select the instance type they would like, customize the command line to run, and output like Amazon S3 bucket. Once running docker image, user can find the launched tasks in Cloud Task list, each task display some details include image names, instance type, status, launched time, command, and instance id. Policies Best Practices Frequently Asked Questions How did GEONEX works? GEONEX consists of data buckets co-located with a group of standard dockerized algorithms as computation service. The datasets houses a large repository of publicly available geostationary datasets as well as GEONEX products. Users can access and analyze data from the public catalog using geonex containers as as well as their own analysis once dockerized. Also users can leverage their work to powerful features provided by GEONEX, including real-time analytics, standard preprocessing, cloud detection, visualization, etc. Which sensors supported? We aim to support the land monitoring capabilities of new generation geostationary platforms, includes: ABI \u2013 Advanced Baseline Imager on GOES-R/T AHI \u2013 Advanced Himawari Imager on Himawari AMI \u2013 Advanced Meteorological Imager on GEO-KOMPSAT2 FCI \u2013 Flexible Combined Imager on MTG AGRI \u2013 Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager on Fengyun-4 What products in plan?","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-geonex","text":"This is a collection of documentation for GeoNEX users.","title":"Welcome to GeoNEX"},{"location":"#get-started","text":"","title":"Get Started"},{"location":"#how-to-register-docker-image","text":"The docker image could come from one public docker hub, where user can directly download it without any permissions.

Framework and user interface improvements now enable GEONEX to be used for streamlining analyzing tens of thousands of CONUS as well as Full Disk Scan of GOES16 and Himawari-9. The new generation of GOES satellites carry the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) with spectral, spatial and radiometric resolutions comparable to EOS workhorse MODIS. More importantly ABI provides observations at 5-15 minute intervals offering exciting possibilities for producing robust biophysical variables by overcoming cloud cover, enabling studies of local-to-regional biosphere-atmosphere interactions, and operational decision-making in agriculture, forestry and range management. The NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) team has been collaborating with the NOAA scientists and planning several GOES/ABI products for land surface monitoring. Many of the proposed products will leverage NASA\u2019s investments in EOS algorithms. Started in 2017, GEONEX continues to focus on the key challenges of data-driven earth science, including but are not limited to, access to sufficient computing resources, massive data transfer, standardized analysis workflows and reproducibility to communicate analyses so that they can be reused and extended. During the last two years, the GEONEX team have made substantial improvements to the core framework, user interface, tools, and training materials. Framework and user interface improvements now enable GEONEX to be used for streamlining analyzing tens of thousands of CONUS as well as Full Disk Scan of GOES16/17 and Himawari-8 , and 7 standardized land products are now produced on GEONEX. GEONEX Concepts GEONEX Account - You need to create it to get access to GEONEX resources, including AWS EC2 instances, repos, containers, tasks and buckets. Buckets - AWS S3 buckets, used as input and output storage of GEONEX products Repos - a dockerized image, within it a combination of a file system and GEO application was built. It can be hosted on public docker registry services (hub.docker; AWS ECR; gcr.io) Containers - a standard unit on GEONEX approved by the administrator to finish specific processing/analysis jobs Runner - the runtime instance of a GEONEX containers (repo). Tasks - containers related to specific output buckets, which can be browsed in the viewer Contact Write to us (geonex84@gmail.com) to get an account on GEONEX.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about-geonex","text":"GEONEX is a web-based scientific platform for addressing on the key challenges of data-driven Geostationary (GEO) datasets, including but are not limited to, access to sufficient computing resources, massive data transfer, standardized analysis workflows and reproducibility to communicate analyses so that they can be reused and extended.
